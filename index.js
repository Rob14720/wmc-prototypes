/*
  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + .eat() should recieve a string as a parameter and take some type of edible as an argument
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach` array.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` array should be empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"
*/

function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.stomach = [];
}
Person.prototype.eat = function(edible){
  if(this.stomach.length < 10){
    this.stomach.push(edible);
  }
}
Person.prototype.poop = function(){
  this.stomach = [];
}
Person.prototype.toString = function(){
  return `${this.name}, ${this.age}`;
}

const robert = new Person('mary', 23)
console.log(robert.toString());
robert.eat('pizza');
console.log(robert.stomach);
robert.poop();
console.log(robert.stomach);
/*
  TASK 2
    - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.
    - All instances built with Car:
        + should initialize with an `tank` at 0
        + should initialize with an `odometer` at 0
    - Give cars the ability to get fueled with a `.fill(gallons)` method
      + should take 'gallons' as an parameter which will take number of gallons as an argument
      + should add the gallons to `tank`.
    - STRETCH: Give cars ability to `.drive(distance)`. The distance driven:
        + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
        + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
    - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
        + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.
*/

function Car(model, milesPerGallon) {
this.model = model ;
this.milesPerGallon = milesPerGallon;
this.tank = 0
this.odometer = 0
}
Car.prototype.fill = function(gallons){
  this.tank = this.tank+gallons;
}
Car.prototype.drive = function(distance){
  this.odometer = this.odometer+distance
}

/*
  TASK 3
    - Write a Baby constructor subclassing Person.
    - Besides `name` and `age`, Baby takes a third argument to initialize `favoriteToy`.
    - Besides the methods on Person.prototype, babies also have the ability to `.play()`:
        + Should return a string "Playing with x", x being the favorite toy.
*/

function Baby(name, age, favoriteToy) {
Person.call(this, name, age);
this.favoriteToy = favoriteToy;
}
Baby.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);
Baby.prototype.play = function(){
  return `Playing with ${this.favoriteToy}`;
}


/* 
  TASK 4
  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. There is the global principle, which are global objects that can be called with 'this', 
  but is highly discouraged from being used.
  2. Implicit binding is the most logical and common usage of 'this'.It's the this that is being used in the funct.
  For an example of it, look at the initialization of the functions above. It's apparent it's calling on the parameters.
  The this keyword itself is being used to bind 'this.x' to a specific parameter.
  3. Since 'this' is all about context, just like in real life, 'New' simply changes the context.
  4. Explicit binding is in the use of .call and .apply methods. From my understanding, apply is exactly like call.
